# Description
#### Building a webpage for Run Buddy, a company that matches runners with personal trainers. Run Buddy is launching a new landing page to attract more sign-ups, and they need someone to build it. My job is to make the Run Buddy landing page look good, and then hand it off to Run Buddy's internal developers to complete the data collection portion.
